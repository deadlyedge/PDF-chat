## try to combine langchain and qdrant

in fact, both openai and google gemini works. in chinese, openai gpt-4 is far more better than gpt-3.5.

qdrant works, but when recreate collection, it shows time out all the time, and need to re run the function to make it work.

langchain have a good start and good ideas, but in the day of exploding ai technics, it seems a little bit lost.
